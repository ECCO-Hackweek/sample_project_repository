# Sample Project

This is as an example on how teams can structure their project repositories and format their project README.md file. Thanks to Lindsey Heagey and Joachim Meyer for the template!

## Files

* `.gitignore`
<br> Globally ignored files by `git` for the project.
* `environment.yml`
<br> `conda` environment description needed to run this project.
* `README.md`
<br> Description of the project (see suggested headings below)

## Folders

This template provides the following folders and suggested organizaiton structure for the project repository, but each project team is free to organize their repository as they see fit.

### `contributors`
Each team member can create their own folder under contributors, within which they can work on their own scripts, notebooks, and other files. Having a dedicated folder for each person helps to prevent conflicts when merging with the main branch. This is a good place for team members to start off exploring data and methods for the project.

### `notebooks`
Notebooks that are considered delivered results for the project should go in here.

### `scripts`
Helper utilities that are shared with the team should go in here.
