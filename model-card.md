Replace this file with your model card. Include separate model-card files if you have several significantly different machine learning models used in your project.

The [idea behind model cards](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1810.03993) is to increase transparency about the design, testing, and application of a machine learning model. These are to be a concise document that can be understood not just by other data scientists or scientists in your specific domain, but also the general public, decision and policy-makers.

Use the [Model Carts Writing Tool](https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface/Model_Cards_Writing_Tool) (or see this [model card template](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/blob/main/src/huggingface_hub/templates/modelcard_template.md) and [annotations](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/model-card-annotated)) to create a model card following the standard adopted by the Hugging Face community. You can also read more about their model card template [here](https://huggingface.co/blog/model-cards), and find other templates and examples online (such as in the original [Mitchell et al. (2018) paper](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1810.03993)) to get ideas of what to include in your model card.
